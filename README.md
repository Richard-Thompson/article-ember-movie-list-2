# Ember-vs-React-Ember

This project is the Ember code relating to the Ember vs Reactâ€” the ultimate battle (Round 1) and 
Ember vs React - round 2 articles.

This is a very basic example of how to get started with Ember. It uses firebase for data persistence
and sass for styling. 

## Common Commands

`ember new <Insert-project-name>` - Creates a new project named ember-movie-list

`ember serve` - Starts the project and go to localhost:4200 to view the project

`ember test` - Runs the tests

## Firebase 

1. You need to make a firebase account.

2. Create a project
  * Click on database tab 
  * Click real time database 
  * Click start in test mode 

3. Go to overview page 

4. Click 'Add firebase to your web app'

5. Copy the firebase object into the newly created firebase.js in the config folder. So it looks similar to this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: ""
  };
```

And then you will have your own firebase setup.
